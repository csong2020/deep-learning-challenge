Module 21 Challenge

The "charity" file was imported, cleaned of non-beneficial columns, and binned.
The data was then split and trained in a neural network model. Accuracy was determined to be 0.732, which means the model could be improved but is not the worst thing in the world. Two alternative models were attempted that increased the hidden layers (0.728) and also the epoch iterations (0.724). There were not any noticeable changes in accuracy, unfortunately. Perhaps increasing the training set or reducing it would increase our accuracy.

Finally, the neural network HDF5 file was exported to the Resources folder.
